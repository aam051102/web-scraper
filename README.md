Warning: This project is old and infficient. It *should* still be functional, but I haven't tested it.


A simple website scraper that can download files. as well as find links, on a website.

To use it, simply download the exe and run it.
Type in the full URL and press enter.
Then type in a folder path and press enter. (Remember to put \ at the end of the folder path.)
Finally, write y, and press enter.
